# Machine_failure_predicttion
Constructed a system to anticipate equipment failures using historical sensor data, ensuring minimal downtime and cost-effective resource allocation.
Employed Python, particularly pandas, to manipulate data effectively. Utilized time series analysis techniques, including ARIMA and LSTM, to
create a robust predictive model. Successfully established a proactive equipment management framework, reducing unplanned downtime and optimizing resource allocation.
